Type 1 diabetes symptoms appear rapidly and are more severe, while type 2 symptoms develop over time.\\n3. Common early signs include increased hunger and fatigue due to the body\\'s inability to use glucose for energy without sufficient insulin.\\n4. Frequent urination and increased thirst occur as the body attempts to eliminate excess glucose, leading to dehydration.\\n5. Dry mouth, itchy skin, and blurred vision are also symptoms, caused by the body\\'s use of fluids to produce urine, affecting hydration and eye lens shape.\\n6. Type 2 diabetes may present with yeast infections, slow-healing sores, and pain or numbness in extremities due to high glucose levels.\\n7. Unplanned weight loss, nausea, and vomiting are signs of type 1 diabetes, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n8. Gestational diabetes typically has no symptoms but may cause increased thirst and urination.\\n9. Complications of diabetes include skin infections, numbness, vision problems, and erectile dysfunction.\\n10.
